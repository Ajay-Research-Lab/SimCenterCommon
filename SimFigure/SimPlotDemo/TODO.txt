1) I can select the curves and need to send the respective signal with the proper curve index.

2) unselect needs to recover the original color and line width
    - introduce a select buffer that stores
        (1) pointer to object
        (2) pen settings
        (3) brudh settings
    - a new selection needs to check whether a previously selected object exists (nullptr)
    - if previous object exists, restore pen and brush settings

3) some helper functions for changing line width and style for existing curves

4) a private map between curve objects (C++-pointers) and plot IDs (MATLAB STYLE)
    - this includes an inverse map for quick identification of selected objects
